y=noise(500)
x=tone(10,100)+tone(10,100)>>200 ( 100ms-audio 100ms-null 100ms-audio)
y(100~400) = x  -- to replace the middle part of y with x including the null portion

Does it work?
I saw it not working (only the first chain of x replacing y(100~200) earlier today, but now it's working fine....

CHECK AGAIN!!!!
