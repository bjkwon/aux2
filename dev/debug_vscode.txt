In tasks.json, look at "args":
"-g", "${file}", --> means the currently opened file (when F5 is pressed) is used for debugging.

If other source files are going to be debugged, list them next to "${file}", 

Let's say skope.cpp and utils.cpp are compiled for debugging:
Don't forget to do
rm skope.o
rm utils.o
(etc)

if they had been created for a non-debugging use. 

How did I find this out?
The build command used when F5 was pressed--> I tried it separately and rev-engineered from the error messages.
