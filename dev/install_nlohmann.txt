sudo apt-get install nlohmann-json3-dev
How did I know nlohmann-json3-dev?
-- sudo apt-file search nlohmann

then checked where it was installed... it is....

/usr/include/nlohmann

(In Jumpbox, nlohmann-json3-dev didn't work. nlohmann-json-dev worked....
but nlohmann-json-dev led to compile errors. 
Had to download nlohmann-json3-dev manually and copy the include directory to /usr/include/nlohmann
then the compile errors disappered)


Needed gdb instead of g++ to launch debugger in VS code
sudo apt-get install gdb
