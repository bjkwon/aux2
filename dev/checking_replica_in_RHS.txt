In the AstNode structure, "next" is used in the following instances:
N_BLOCK

The following uses N_BLOCK:
T_FOR T_WHILE T_IF T_SWITCH T_TRY

All of the above, "next" demarcates an expression or statement. The search for replica should end at the end of expression or statement.

However, in other instances where "next" is used, including many arithmetic operations using makeFunctionCall, compound operators and ++, the search should continue through "next."
