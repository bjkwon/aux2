1. Default behaviors
	NULL input goes in as is
	
NULL as input
1. Handle the NULL input, generate the output (which may be NULL) or issue an error
2. Bypass the function and generate a NULL output (when used for arg0)


[].otype --> need to process with 0xFFFF, return something (0)
[].issame([]) -->  need to process with 0xFFFF, return something (1 bool)
[].dir --> process NULL, treat it an empty string  (i.e., do something with the NULL input)

[].std(1) --> process NULL, error
[].noise --> process NULL, error
tone(400,[]) --> process NULL, error


[].sum --> bypass, return [] 
[].max --> bypass, return [] 



Can't think about any example where func(value,[]) --> bypass
func(value,[]) should be either error, or another value or the result after processing []
