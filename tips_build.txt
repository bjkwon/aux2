To build in Linux, edit sndfile.h 
Change __int64 --> int64_t

There must be a way to compile without editing such, because I did it in Dec 16 2021, but I can't replicate it today.
 
g++ -I . -I include/ *.cpp *.c _func/*.cpp -o aux2 -l :libsndfile.so.1 -l :libfftw3f.so.3

How did I figure out libsndfile.so.1 and libfftw3f.so.3?
-- in shell,
$ ldconfig -p | grep libsndfile.so
and
$ ldconfig -p | grep libfftw

and find out the proper name of the library installed in the system.
If those libraries are not installed, install them first.

To compile and build in Mac, a few steps are needed.
